# Weather Wizard
Weather Wizard is a weather app that consumes the Visual Crossing Weather API to provide weather forecasts for the current day of the city searched. It also changes the background dynamically to better suit the conditions of the weather. Example:
Searching for a city that has a sunny weather will automatically change the background to one with a sunny picture once the API data is received.

## Usage
I recommend visting the website on a desktop / laptop, as the site isn't mobile responsive yet.
